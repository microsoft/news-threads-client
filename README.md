# Introduction

News Threads Client is a web application for exploring and tracing news provenance across time over a collection of documents. This project can ingest and analyze data produced by the [News-Threads](https://github.com/microsoft/News-Threads) data pipeline.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [**Node**](https://nodejs.org) (check `package.json::engines` for version details)
- [**Pnpm**](https://pnpm.js.org/en/) (check `package.json::engines` for version details)
- [**MongoDB**](https://mongodb.com)
- [**Azure CLI**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [**Azure Functions Core**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools)

## Data Ingestion

The scripts package provides commands for ingesting data produced by [News-Threads](https://github.com/microsoft/News-Threads). See [packages/scripts](packages/scripts/README.md) for more information and instructions.

## Configuration

By default, the Azure Function API will run on port `7071` and connect to a local MongoDB instance, `mongodb://localhost:27017/`. Default configuration settings can be changed by updating `packages/<package>/config/default.json`. Alternatively, default configuration settings can be overwritten by adding `local-<NODE_ENV>.json` configuration files to the corresponding config directory.

## Startup

```sh
> pnpm install # --ignore-engines (if azure gives you grief about node version)
> pnpm start
```

The webapp will be available at http://localhost:8080
